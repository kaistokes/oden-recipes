        <p>One of the most loved foods in the world is finally here! This is a traditional Italian Lasagna, made the Italian way with layers of slow cooked Bolognese ragu and cheese sauce. No ricotta – that’s the American-Italian version. Though patience is required, it is quite straight forward to make as you will see in the recipe video!</p>

        <p>Ingredients
            <ul>
                <li>Onion, garlic, carrot and celery – for the flavour base, a soffrito;</li>
                <li>Beef</li>
                <li>Canned tomato and tomato paste</li>
                <li>Red wine – for extra flavour!</li>
                <li>Seasonings – beef bouillon cubes (stock cubes), bay leaves, thyme, oregano, Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>butter</li>
                <li>flour</li>
                <li>milk</li>
                <li>cheese</li>
                <li>lasagna sheets – preferably fresh (from the fridge section of grocery stores) but dried works just fine too</li>
                <li>cheese!</li>


            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>And here is how you layer it up:</p>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Smear</strong> a bit of sauce on the base first – stops the lasagna sheets from sliding around;</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 1 - </strong> top with meat sauce, bit of white sauce</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 2 - </strong> lay out more lasagna sheets, then top with more meat sauce and more white sauce </li>
                <li><strong>Layer 3 </strong>– repeat again, lasagna sheets, meat sauce then white sauce; and</li>
                <li><strong>Topping</strong>  – cover with lasagna sheets, pour over remaining white sauce then sprinkle with cheese.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
